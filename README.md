Small C# Console Application created as part of a coding challenge for a job role.

The application solves mazes that are provided in text files. An example maze:

1 1 1 1 1

1 S 0 0 1

1 0 1 0 1

1 0 1 0 1

1 0 1 E 1

1 1 1 1 1

The program will mark out the route to the end with 'X' characters like:

1 1 1 1 1

1 S X X 1

1 0 1 X 1

1 0 1 X 1

1 0 1 E 1

1 1 1 1 1

The 'Test Mazes' folder has a couple of example mazes to test the program with. Provide a file path to the maze file during execution to see the solution. E.g. MBrand_MazeSolver.exe "C:\input.txt"
