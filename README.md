Small C# Console Application created as part of a coding challenge for a job role.

The application solves mazes that are provided in text files. An example maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 S 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 E 1
1 1 1 1 1

The program will mark out the route to the end with 'X' characters like:

1 1 1 1 1
1 S X X 1
1 0 1 X 1
1 0 1 X 1
1 0 1 E 1
1 1 1 1 1
